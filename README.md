If you were on my PC, I would drag this to C:\Users\NITRO. Just find the counterpart to this. 


Right click on my-app and run the following in sequential order:

npm i react-router-dom --save (do it in my-app, right click my-app and open in integrated terminal)

npm install axios ( integrated terminal after react-router-dom has been done )

node index.js (click terminal and select New Terminal)

npm start (do it in my-app, right click my-app and open in integrated terminal again)
